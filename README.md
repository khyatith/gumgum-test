The quiz questions are answered in the quiz file.


I have used codeigniter as my MVC pattern. 

Weather application:
Controller :display_cities.php
Views :  FirstPage.php and DisplayWeather.php
Model : populatecities.php

Some things that I missed :
I found out while uploading that I had to use multi select list for cities. Unfortunately I have a mid-term so I could not make that change. As soon as I get over with my exam, I would try to make the changes like using AJAX and creating multi-select list (if time permits)
I used Bootstrap for the UI. Since codeigniter provides active records to handle SQL Injection, I did not feel the need for using PDO. I have used active records for avoiding SQL injection.

Data Visualization
COntroller : visualization_controller.php
Views: Visualization_view.php
I have displayed the x-axis as year and the column in the chart represents the percentage change in the data over the years. Also, the annotations are used for displaying the inital values taken from the xml document.

FizzBuzz
fizzbuzz.php.
Unfortunately, exam prep and working on other project did not permit me to write the unit test for the fizzbuzz. However, I can give an explanation of how to create the unit test for the same if it is necessary.

I really enjoyed working with google weather and visualization API. Looking forward to working on cool stuff like this in gumgum !
